# @pradyunsg's Solarized theme for Visual Studio Code

I wanted a Solarized based Visual Studio Code theme that:

- uses the colors in a way that I find visually pleasing.
- actually uses the suggested foreground and background colours.
  - the built-in theme uses higher contrast than the specification.

That didn't exist, as far as I could tell. So... I made this!

## Installation

This isn't on the extension store. For now, you can clone this directly
in your extensions folder.
